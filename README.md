### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Addison. I like to build online services, code APIs, and play with AI.

I was in a restrictive non-compete clause until the end of 2023, so much of the code I've written is private. However, I was recently laid off so now I can post whateevr I want! ðŸ˜„

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph theory because it applies to a lot of the different ML algorithms I work on. Any reccomendations?
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with AI, helping to build an API for the public good, or anything to do with code and gardening!

  
#### ðŸ“« I'm Looking for a job! ðŸ“«
